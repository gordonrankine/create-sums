# Create-Sums
A set of PowerShell scripts that will create sums in an Excel spreadsheet that will auto check the answers.

## Why These Scripts

As of 23rd March 2020 schools in Scotland are closing due to the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic. So I wanted to create some PowerShell scripts that my young kids could run themselves to keep their mental arithmetic going. There are plenty of websites that have this type of thing but a lot of them are riddled with adverts and such like and requires the internet. This script once downloaded doesn't.
